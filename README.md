# Personal Website (Next.js)

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Update content

Edit the structured copy in `src/content/*` (hero, about, experience, skills, certifications, projects, contact).

## Portrait image

The hero uses `public/portrait.png` (copied from the repo's `image.png`).
Replace `public/portrait.png` with your preferred portrait to update the site.

## Contact & hosting details

Update links and contact info in `src/content/site.ts` and `src/content/contact.ts`.
